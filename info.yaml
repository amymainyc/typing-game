  Our project is an interactive typing game. We created bags of words that creates randomly generated
  text sequences for users to type. We have a timer showing the user how long they were typing and a UI 
  interface to show what users have typed. We have different visual modes and different types of bags 
  to get a wide variety of text sequences.
